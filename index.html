		   <li>Growth doesn&apos;t happen, growth is intentional. </li>
		   <li>We have to pursue growth for there are blessings that God will not give to the immature.</li>
		   <li>God intentionally made us&hypen; we were not spoken into existence like the rest of the creation. He took the time to form us and gave us His breath.</li>
		   <li>"The mistake gap-" when we are afraid of making mistake. </li>
		   <li>As we seek to grow, there is always a fear of the unknown that creeps in.</li>
		   <li>We fail to grow because of fear that we allowto grow in our hearts.</li>
		   <li>We become paralyzed from reaching our destiny.</li>
		   <li>How we grow may not be how someone else grows&hypen; let anxiety not paralyze us; we have to do away with insecurities and anxieties.</li>
		   <li>Only God and only God gives real guarantees.</li>
		   <li>God gives us chances to fix our mistakes; persistence makes us move forward. </li>
		   <li>Fear serves to stop us from advancing forward, and we should walk away from it.</li>
		   <li>Immaturity will make us waste our resources and talents.</li>
